# OneTimeAccess

OneTimeAccess is a simple web application that generates unique, one-time-use links for accessing restricted content or pages securely. With the increasing need for secure access control, OneTimeAccess provides an easy-to-use solution to share content with users while ensuring that access is limited to a single use.

## Usage

1. Generate a one-time access link for the desired content or page.
2. Share the generated link with intended recipients.
3. Recipients can access the content using the provided link, which expires after the first use.
